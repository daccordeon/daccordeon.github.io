  Hi, I'm James, and I'm a physics PhD candidate. I'm currently visiting Caltech for 3 years as part of my PhD at The Australian National University!

  My research interests include <mark>Quantum Metrology</mark>, <mark>Quantum Squeezing</mark>, and <mark>Gravitational Waves</mark>. I enjoy discovering a simple understanding of physical phenomena from complex analytic models. I believe in Open Research and Open Source. My full CV is available as a PDF [here](https://daccordeon.github.io/assets/James_W_Gardner_CV.pdf) and I include highlights below.

  My current office is Room 369, Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. Do drop in!

          I started a Physics PhD at ANU in June 2022. I'm currently closely collaborating with Yanbei Chen and others on an 3-year visit to Caltech in Pasadena CA, USA. My research involves theoretical work in quantum optomechanics for precision metrology.

          During my time at ANU, I enjoyed learning through asking many fruitful questions and found good company and help from my peers.

          My First Class Honours thesis is available [here](https://daccordeon.github.io/assets/James_W_Gardner_Honours_thesis.pdf), in which I explored a novel use of quantum squeezing to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors (called <mark>Nondegenerate Internal Squeezing</mark>). The slides for my final Honours talk to the ANU School of Physics are available [here](https://daccordeon.github.io/assets/James_W_Gardner_Honours_final_talk_slides.pdf).

          I worked as a research assistant at CGA on benchmarking future gravitational-wave detector networks to assess the science case for a detector in Australia. This involved Python programming using an existing package (gwbench) and Bash scripting to interact with Swinburne's OzStar supercomputer. A paper is in preparation on this work.

      When I am not working in the quantum realm, I enjoy playing games and music with friends. I love storytelling and Dungeons & Dragons. I play the trombone (jazz) and piano accordion (folk) and adore Don Ellis's [*Autumn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t9oC765WpU&list=PLJa9-iROmUztRhNws6VyqZFvakxiWmH28). When the weather is fine, you may also find me resting on a mountainside.
