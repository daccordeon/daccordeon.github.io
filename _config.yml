  Hi, I'm James, and I'm a physics research student. I'm currently visiting the California Institute of Technology as an extended part of my PhD at The Australian National University's Centre for Gravitational Astrophysics.

  My research interests include <mark>Quantum Metrology</mark>, <mark>Quantum Squeezing</mark>, and <mark>Gravitational Waves</mark>. I enjoy discovering a simple understanding of physical phenomena from complex analytic models. I believe in Open Research and Open Source. My CV is available as a PDF [here](https://daccordeon.github.io/assets/James_W_Gardner_CV.pdf).

          I started a Physics PhD at ANU in June 2022. I'm currently in close collaboration with and visiting The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena CA, USA. My research involves theoretical work in quantum opto-mechanics for precision metrology.

          During my time at ANU, I enjoyed learning through asking many fruitful questions and found good company and help from my peers.

          My First Class Honours thesis is available [here](https://daccordeon.github.io/assets/James_W_Gardner_Honours_thesis.pdf), in which I explored a novel use of quantum squeezing to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors (called <mark>Nondegenerate Internal Squeezing</mark>). The slides for my final Honours talk to the ANU School of Physics are available [here](https://daccordeon.github.io/assets/James_W_Gardner_Honours_final_talk_slides.pdf).

          I am currently working as a research assistant at CGA on benchmarking future gravitational-wave detector networks to assess the science case for a detector in Australia. This involved Python programming using an existing package (gwbench) and Bash scripting to interact with Swinburne's OzStar supercomputer.

      When I am not working in the quantum realm, I enjoy playing games and music with friends. I love storytelling and Dungeons & Dragons. I play the trombone (jazz) and piano accordion (folk) and adore Don Ellis's [*Autumn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t9oC765WpU&list=PLJa9-iROmUztRhNws6VyqZFvakxiWmH28).
